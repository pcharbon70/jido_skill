# Phase 55 Acceptance Checklist

## Backfill Missing Acceptance Contracts

- [x] Backfilled missing acceptance contract documents for historical implementation phases:
  - `phase-7-acceptance.md`
  - `phase-9-acceptance.md`
  - `phase-47-acceptance.md`
- [x] Backfilled contracts align with implemented behavior and test coverage already present in the corresponding phase branches/merged work.
- [x] Contracts directory maintains explicit documentation continuity across historical phase numbering.

## Validation

- [x] Verified the backfilled contract documents exist under `docs/contracts/` and follow the same checklist format used by other phase acceptance documents.
- [x] Confirmed this phase records the historical documentation backfill event (PR #58) so phase numbering remains auditable end to end.
